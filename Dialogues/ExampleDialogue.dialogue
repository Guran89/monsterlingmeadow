I found this weird crystal looking rock while I was out.
It kind of looks like egg, donâ€™t you think?
What should we do with it? 

- Let's try to hatch it! => hatch_egg
- We could crack it open? => open_egg
- Where did you find it?
	Just outside a large cave south of here.
	It looked like it had rolled out from the cave.
	- I think we better return it.
		Awww... Do we have to?
		- Yes. That's for the best. => return_egg
		- On second thought, no. Keep it.
			Really? Yay!
			- We should try and hatch it instead. => hatch_egg
			- I say we crack it open right now. => open_egg
	- Wanna crack it open? => open_egg
	- I say we hatch it. => hatch_egg

~ open_egg
Let's do this!
What's inside? What's inside?
Wait, what is this!?
Ewww! It's some kind of black goo! And it stinks!
Make it go awaaaaayyyy!

Oooh, that's exciting!
Let's put it someplace warm and cozy.
And now we wait.
